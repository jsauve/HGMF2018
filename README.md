# HGMF2018
The official app of the 2018 Duluth Homegrown Music Festival

## Setup (as of 4/17/18)

* Install Visual Studio for Mac (or Visual Studio for PC; but Mac is better)
* Copy `SettingsTemplate.cs` to `Settings.cs`
* Build and run

### Note
You may see shit leftover from last year's app. I've gutted most of it, but there may be some remnants.
